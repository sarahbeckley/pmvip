            I'm Patrick Morales, founder of PM VIP Fitness, and I'm here to tell
            you that there is hope when struggling with depression and anxiety.
            I am an ACE certified personal trainer that has experienced severe
            depression and have used physical exercise, nutrition and mindset to
            overcome this dehabilitating time in my life.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Exercise and proper nutrition has helped shape who I am today and
            gave me the confidence to move forward no matter what I am going
            through. I couldn't have accomplished this happier self without
            molding my mindset through positive thinking and meditation. Mindset
            has improved my life drastically and i've realized that this is the
            foundation to recovery.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My functional training program will help build the essentials needed
            to permanently change your life and help you better cope with the
            effects of depression and anxiety. I specialize in people working
            with depression and anxiety, but I also provide services for the
            more experienced weight lifter.
